# Music Player Demo

This is a minimal Vite + React scaffold created to run the single file `music_player_ui_mockup_auth_playlists_search.jsx` (renamed to `MusicPlayerMock.jsx`).

How to run (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\fr927\Downloads\HW PROJECTS\database_systems\music-player-demo"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the address printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- The project contains small stub UI components under `src/components/ui` so the component can render. Styling classes (Tailwind) are present in the JSX but Tailwind isn't configured here — the UI will be functional but not fully styled.
- If you want the exact styling, I can add Tailwind setup and convert the classes to work with it.
